## Production Domain
- **Website**: https://www.visionary-suite.com

## What's Been Implemented

### Phase 2: Premium Landing Page (Conversion Engine) — April 2026
- **Use Case Rails** — 8-card Netflix-style grid: Kids Bedtime Stories, Viral Reels, YouTube Shorts, Comics, Business Promos, Photo to Comic, GIFs, Story Episodes
- **Pain Removal Section** — "Stop wasting hours editing" + 6 pain points + "One prompt → finished video"
- **Pricing Teaser** — Free (₹0/10 credits) vs Pro (₹149/week/40 credits) comparison
- **FAQ Section** — 6 expandable accordion questions covering key objections
- Existing sections preserved: Hero (A/B tested), How it Works, Social Proof, Showcase, Review Wall, Final CTA

### Phase 3: Growth Flywheel (User Growth Engine) — April 2026
- **ShareButtons component** — One-tap sharing: WhatsApp, X, Facebook, Copy Link, Native Share (mobile)
- Wired into StoryPreview (after generation complete)
- PublicCreation share pages already had remix CTAs + "Create Your Version" + share buttons (enhanced)

### Phase 4: Monetization Loop (Revenue Engine) — April 2026
- **SmartUpgradePrompt component** — Context-sensitive upgrade prompts after wow moments
- Triggers: generation_complete, share_success, low_credits, second_use
- 24h cooldown, doesn't show for users with >20 credits
- Premium feel (non-spammy), slide-in from bottom, dismiss option

### Responsive Framework (Phase 1) — April 2026
- 20-module responsive.css design system
- Universal PageHeader component
- All modals viewport-safe (p-4 padding)
- Desktop frozen baseline, zero regressions

### Pipeline Reliability + Quality — April 22, 2026

**P0 Reliability (guardrails):**
- `pipeline_engine.py` — pre-COMPLETED validation block:
  - Probes final `render_path` with ffmpeg, extracts duration + audio stream presence
  - FAILS job with structured `validation_failures` array (NO_RENDER_PATH, RENDER_FILE_MISSING, DURATION_TOO_SHORT, NO_AUDIO_STREAM, PROBE_FAILED, JOB_DOC_MISSING)
  - On fail: auto-refunds `credit_cost` to user + creates `PIPELINE_REFUND` ledger entry
  - Stores `diagnostics` dict on job (duration_sec, audio_stream_present, scenes_rendered/voiced, min_duration_sec)
  - Fresh-message WS push: "Generation failed — credits refunded. Please try again."
- `routes/pipeline_admin.py` (new):
  - `GET /api/admin/pipeline/diagnostics?limit=N` — per-job health + summary
  - `POST /api/admin/pipeline/cleanup-false-completed` — retroactive fix (executed: 8 jobs flipped)

**P1 Quality (dynamic scenes):**
- `PLAN_SCENE_LIMITS` raised `3/4/5/6` → `6/8/10` (matching spec)
- Dynamic scene sizing by story length: <400 chars = 6 scenes, <1200 = 8, else 10
- Scenes must pass plan-tier ceiling (free=6, paid=8, premium=10)

**P1 Quality (Character Bible — 2-pass prompt):**
- Pass 1: dedicated LLM call builds locked JSON bible: characters (name/age/hair/face/clothing/body/props/palette) + setting (environment/time/palette)
- Bible compressed into `bible_text` injected verbatim into scene generation system prompt
- Bible stored on job doc for future reference/debug
- Scene generator told: "use LOCKED descriptions verbatim in EVERY scene"

**Audit Before/After:**
- False completed jobs: 8 → **0**
- Scene count default: 3 → **6 (free), 8 (paid), 10 (premium)**
- Duration minimum enforced: **20s (short) / 40s (long+)**
- Audio validation: **now required for COMPLETED**

### Deferred to next session (out of this sprint's scope)
- True motion video-gen (Sora-2/Veo-3) — needs cost model
- Parallax layers + blinking + particle motion in renderer
- Lip-sync animation
- Safari-specific codec audit (needs device repro)

### Referral Economy Rebalance (monetization hardening) — April 22, 2026

**Tier matrix (replaces unlimited 300 flat model):**
| Tier | Credits/ref | Monthly cap | Max/month | Purchase bonus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FREE | 150 | 2 | 300 | +200 |
| PAID | 300 | 5 | 1,500 | +500 |
| PREMIUM | 500 | 10 | 5,000 | +700 |

**Key logic:**
- Tier resolved from `users.plan_type` + `subscription_status`
- Monthly counters reset on month boundary (UTC `YYYY-MM` key)
- `_compute_cap_state(user_id)` returns tier, credits_per_ref, cap, monthly_used, monthly_credits, remaining, cap_reached
- `_grant_reward` now returns `{granted, credits, reason, tier}` — blocks with `CAP_REACHED`
- Cap hits tracked per profile (`monthly_cap_hits`)

**Purchase bonus hook:**
- `grant_referral_purchase_bonus(user_id, amount)` called from `process_payment_success` in subscriptions.py
- 30-day purchase window from referral creation
- Idempotent per attribution (`type: PURCHASE_BONUS`)
- Updates `paid_referral_conversions` counter

**Credit expiry:**
- Referral rewards expire after 45 days
- Purchase bonuses expire after 60 days
- Background sweep every 6h (`referral_expiry_loop`)
- Manual trigger: `POST /api/referrals/admin/run-expiry-sweep`
- On expiry: deducts unused credits from balance, creates REFERRAL_EXPIRY ledger entry, flips reward to EXPIRED

**Ledger:** `source_type`, `expires_at`, `source_user_id`, `referral_id`, `reward_id` fields added

**User dashboard:**
- Tier badge (FREE/PAID/PREMIUM) with Crown/Zap icons
- Monthly progress card: `1 / 10 referrals used` + progress bar
- Upsell banners contextual by tier (cap_reached → Upgrade CTA · FREE → unlock bigger rewards · PAID → Go Annual)
- Expiry disclosure: "Referral credits expire 45d, purchase bonuses 60d. Purchased credits never expire."

**Admin dashboard (/app/admin/referrals):**
- New Monetization Health card: Credits Issued This Month, Purchase Bonuses, Referred Paid Users, Expired Credits Total, Cap Hits by Tier
- Run expiry sweep button
- Tier matrix summary displayed
- Force grant purchase bonus: `POST /api/referrals/admin/grant-purchase-bonus/{user_id}`

### Referral Bonus Program — "Invite & Earn" — April 22, 2026 (baseline)

- Fraud: self-referral, same IP, same device fingerprint, disposable email → REJECTED with reason
- Qualification: New user signup + verified + first COMPLETED pipeline_job OR ready story → 300 credits auto-granted
- Idempotent — `referral_rewards.attribution_id` uniqueness
- Streak: +500 bonus every 3 valid referrals

- `GET /api/referrals/admin/attributions?status=...`
- `POST /api/referrals/admin/review` — admin approve/reject/reverse

**Frontend:**
- `/refer?code=XXX` — public invite landing (premium dark, persists code to localStorage)

## Visual Delight Sprint Phase 1 — April 23, 2026
**Status**: SHIPPED + VERIFIED (3 test stories rendered + probed)

### Root cause fixed
The pipeline orchestrator was never invoking the `render` stage — STAGES list only
ran scenes/images/voices, then went straight to packaging/validation. The validation
gate would detect `NO_RENDER_PATH` and fail the job. This is the real reason users
complained about "3–5s static slideshows with missing audio" — there was no video
being produced at all, and the storypack ZIP was the only asset users ever saw.
Fix: wired `_run_stage("render")` and `_run_stage("upload")` after voices complete
in `execute_pipeline`; added render/upload to STAGES dict, STAGE_RUNNERS, STAGE_PROGRESS,
STAGE_LABELS.

### Cinematic Motion Pack (`pipeline_engine.py`)
Eased progress curves replace linear Ken Burns. 11 motion profiles live in
`CINEMATIC_MOTION_PACK`:
- Wonder/Emotional: `dolly_reveal`, `slow_zoom_in`, `parallax_drift`, `hold_then_push`
- Action: `dolly_push`, `pan_sweep_right`, `pan_sweep_left`, `impact_zoom`
- Kids: `zoom_in_wonder`, `pan_right_bright`, `zoom_out_reveal`

### Pacing Engine
5 pacing profiles (`kids`, `action`, `emotional`, `cinematic`, `auto`) control
motion selection + per-scene duration envelope + fade timing + (future) BGM ducking.
Opening scene gets extra breath, closing scene gets ending beat. Auto-detection
from story text keywords when `pacing_mode="auto"`.

### Safari audio fix (faststart + AAC-LC)
Final encode now emits:
- `-movflags +faststart` (moov atom at head for streaming)
- `-profile:a aac_low` (LC profile — broad iOS/Safari compat)
- `-ar 44100 -ac 2` (stereo 44.1kHz — no mono edge-cases)
- Bumped `-b:a 96k` → `128k`
Verified in all 3 test outputs: moov at byte 36, AAC (LC) 44.1kHz stereo.

### Pipeline duration bug fixed
`-loop 1 -t dur -i` + zoompan `d=N` was producing 18-minute outputs (zoompan
emits `d` output frames per input frame, image loop feeds many). Added
`trim=duration={dur},setpts=PTS-STARTPTS` after zoompan to cap scene video length.
Audio chain now uses `apad,atrim=duration={dur}` to keep A/V in lockstep.

### Per-scene audio + video fades
Every segment has `fade=t=in` / `fade=t=out` with pacing-driven durations
(e.g., emotional uses 0.4s fades + 0.7s intro + 1.0s outro; action uses 0.1s fades).
Audio fades (`afade`) mirror video fades for silky transitions.

### API changes
- New request field `pacing_mode` on `POST /api/pipeline/create` and
  `POST /api/video/assemble`. Values: `auto | kids | action | emotional | cinematic`.
  Default `auto` with keyword heuristic.
- Job document now stores `pacing_mode` + `motion_plan` for observability.

### Files changed
- `backend/services/pipeline_engine.py` — motion pack, pacing engine, render stage wiring, duration fix, Safari flags
- `backend/services/optimized_video_renderer.py` — same motion pack, pacing, sidechain audio ducking, faststart remux, AAC-LC
- `backend/routes/pipeline_routes.py` — `pacing_mode` in `CreatePipelineRequest`
- `backend/routes/story_video_generation.py` — `pacing_mode` in `VideoAssemblyRequest`
- `backend/tests/visual_delight_smoke.py` — 3-story smoke test harness

### Smoke-test proof (Apr 23, 2026 @ 15:01 UTC)
| Genre | Pacing | Scenes | Duration | Size | Motion plan | FastStart | Audio |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Kids (Rainbow Bunny) | kids | 6 | 31.83s | 8.3MB | zoom_in_wonder, pan_right_bright, parallax_drift, zoom_out_reveal, dolly_reveal, zoom_out_reveal | ✅ | AAC-LC 44.1k st |
| Action (Warrior's Last Sprint) | action | 8 | 41.67s | 10.5MB | dolly_push, pan_sweep_right, impact_zoom, pan_sweep_left, dolly_push, impact_zoom, dolly_push, dolly_push | ✅ | AAC-LC 44.1k st |
| Emotional (Letter from Grandmother) | emotional | 8 | 47.40s | 7.2MB | dolly_reveal, slow_zoom_in, parallax_drift, hold_then_push, slow_zoom_in, dolly_reveal, slow_zoom_in, hold_then_push | ✅ | AAC-LC 44.1k st |

Encode wall-clock: 4.6–6.1s per job (single-pass filter_complex).

### Not yet shipped (Phase 2 backlog)
- Ambient effects (particles, smoke, rain, glow)
- Character life cycles (blink, idle sway, mouth movement)
- True crossfade transitions (xfade filter between scenes)
- BGM integration into the pipeline_engine path (currently only in legacy
  optimized_video_renderer)
