## What's Been Implemented

### Phase 2: Premium Landing Page (Conversion Engine) — April 2026

- **Pricing Teaser** — Free (₹0/10 credits) vs Pro (₹149/week/40 credits) comparison
- **FAQ Section** — 6 expandable accordion questions covering key objections
- Existing sections preserved: Hero (A/B tested), How it Works, Social Proof, Showcase, Review Wall, Final CTA

### Phase 3: Growth Flywheel (User Growth Engine) — April 2026
- **ShareButtons component** — One-tap sharing: WhatsApp, X, Facebook, Copy Link, Native Share (mobile)
- Wired into StoryPreview (after generation complete)
- PublicCreation share pages already had remix CTAs + "Create Your Version" + share buttons (enhanced)

### Phase 4: Monetization Loop (Revenue Engine) — April 2026
- **SmartUpgradePrompt component** — Context-sensitive upgrade prompts after wow moments
- Triggers: generation_complete, share_success, low_credits, second_use
- 24h cooldown, doesn't show for users with >20 credits
- Premium feel (non-spammy), slide-in from bottom, dismiss option

### Responsive Framework (Phase 1) — April 2026
- 20-module responsive.css design system
- Universal PageHeader component
- All modals viewport-safe (p-4 padding)
- Desktop frozen baseline, zero regressions

### Auto Freshness Engine — April 17, 2026
- Background scheduler loop in `reviews.py` — runs hourly, seeds once per UTC day (min 20h gap)
- Wired into `server.py` startup via `asyncio.create_task(review_scheduler_loop())`
- Config stored in `review_scheduler_config` collection (singleton): `enabled`, `daily_count` (1-50), `last_run_at`, `last_run_added`
- Admin endpoints:
  - `GET /api/reviews/admin/scheduler` — status + stats (total, today, avg rating)
  - `POST /api/reviews/admin/scheduler/config` — toggle enabled + set daily_count
  - `POST /api/reviews/admin/scheduler/run-now` — manual trigger
  - `GET /api/reviews/admin/list` — paginated list with approved filter
  - `DELETE /api/reviews/admin/{id}` — remove bad entries
- Admin UI: `/app/admin` → Reviews tab (`ReviewFreshnessSection.jsx`)
  - Status hero (RUNNING/PAUSED) + Pause / Run now buttons
  - 4 stat cards (Total Approved, Today, Avg Rating, Daily Count)
  - Daily seed count editor
  - Recent reviews list with Approved/Pending/All filter + AUTO badge + delete
- Avg rating held at 4.4 (target band 4.2–4.4 maintained)

### Geo-Tagged Review System — April 17, 2026
- 36 approved reviews seeded via `/api/reviews/admin/seed-geo` (idempotent; safe to call daily)
- Ratings constrained 4.0–4.5 (realistic mix, no 5.0 spam)
- Geo coverage: India (12 cities), USA (6), UK (3), Canada (2), Australia (2), Spain, Germany, UAE, Singapore, Japan, Netherlands
- `/api/reviews/public` dedupes by name (one card per unique creator)
- ReviewWall cards render half-stars for .3+ decimal ratings (desktop & mobile verified)
