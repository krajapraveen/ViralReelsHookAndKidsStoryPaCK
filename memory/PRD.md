# Visionary Suite — Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Evolve the platform from a standard AI content generator into a highly addictive "Story Multiplayer Engine" built on viral network effects.

## Production Domain
- **Website**: https://www.visionary-suite.com

## What's Been Implemented

### Phase 2: Premium Landing Page (Conversion Engine) — April 2026
- **Use Case Rails** — 8-card Netflix-style grid: Kids Bedtime Stories, Viral Reels, YouTube Shorts, Comics, Business Promos, Photo to Comic, GIFs, Story Episodes
- **Pain Removal Section** — "Stop wasting hours editing" + 6 pain points + "One prompt → finished video"
- **Pricing Teaser** — Free (₹0/10 credits) vs Pro (₹149/week/40 credits) comparison
- **FAQ Section** — 6 expandable accordion questions covering key objections
- Existing sections preserved: Hero (A/B tested), How it Works, Social Proof, Showcase, Review Wall, Final CTA

### Phase 3: Growth Flywheel (User Growth Engine) — April 2026
- **ShareButtons component** — One-tap sharing: WhatsApp, X, Facebook, Copy Link, Native Share (mobile)
- Wired into StoryPreview (after generation complete)
- PublicCreation share pages already had remix CTAs + "Create Your Version" + share buttons (enhanced)

### Phase 4: Monetization Loop (Revenue Engine) — April 2026
- **SmartUpgradePrompt component** — Context-sensitive upgrade prompts after wow moments
- Triggers: generation_complete, share_success, low_credits, second_use
- 24h cooldown, doesn't show for users with >20 credits
- Premium feel (non-spammy), slide-in from bottom, dismiss option

### Responsive Framework (Phase 1) — April 2026
- 20-module responsive.css design system
- Universal PageHeader component
- All modals viewport-safe (p-4 padding)
- Desktop frozen baseline, zero regressions

### Referral Economy Rebalance (monetization hardening) — April 22, 2026

**Tier matrix (replaces unlimited 300 flat model):**
| Tier | Credits/ref | Monthly cap | Max/month | Purchase bonus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FREE | 150 | 2 | 300 | +200 |
| PAID | 300 | 5 | 1,500 | +500 |
| PREMIUM | 500 | 10 | 5,000 | +700 |

**Key logic:**
- Tier resolved from `users.plan_type` + `subscription_status`
- Monthly counters reset on month boundary (UTC `YYYY-MM` key)
- `_compute_cap_state(user_id)` returns tier, credits_per_ref, cap, monthly_used, monthly_credits, remaining, cap_reached
- `_grant_reward` now returns `{granted, credits, reason, tier}` — blocks with `CAP_REACHED`
- Cap hits tracked per profile (`monthly_cap_hits`)

**Purchase bonus hook:**
- `grant_referral_purchase_bonus(user_id, amount)` called from `process_payment_success` in subscriptions.py
- 30-day purchase window from referral creation
- Idempotent per attribution (`type: PURCHASE_BONUS`)
- Updates `paid_referral_conversions` counter

**Credit expiry:**
- Referral rewards expire after 45 days
- Purchase bonuses expire after 60 days
- Background sweep every 6h (`referral_expiry_loop`)
- Manual trigger: `POST /api/referrals/admin/run-expiry-sweep`
- On expiry: deducts unused credits from balance, creates REFERRAL_EXPIRY ledger entry, flips reward to EXPIRED

**Ledger:** `source_type`, `expires_at`, `source_user_id`, `referral_id`, `reward_id` fields added

**User dashboard:**
- Tier badge (FREE/PAID/PREMIUM) with Crown/Zap icons
- Monthly progress card: `1 / 10 referrals used` + progress bar
- Upsell banners contextual by tier (cap_reached → Upgrade CTA · FREE → unlock bigger rewards · PAID → Go Annual)
- Expiry disclosure: "Referral credits expire 45d, purchase bonuses 60d. Purchased credits never expire."

**Admin dashboard (/app/admin/referrals):**
- New Monetization Health card: Credits Issued This Month, Purchase Bonuses, Referred Paid Users, Expired Credits Total, Cap Hits by Tier
- Run expiry sweep button
- Tier matrix summary displayed
- Force grant purchase bonus: `POST /api/referrals/admin/grant-purchase-bonus/{user_id}`

### Referral Bonus Program — "Invite & Earn" — April 22, 2026 (baseline)

**Backend (`/app/backend/routes/referrals.py`):**
- Collections: `referral_profiles`, `referral_attributions`, `referral_events`, `referral_rewards`
- Signup hook in `auth.py` — `UserCreate.referral_code` attaches on register
- Fraud: self-referral, same IP, same device fingerprint, disposable email → REJECTED with reason
- Qualification: New user signup + verified + first COMPLETED pipeline_job OR ready story → 300 credits auto-granted
- Idempotent — `referral_rewards.attribution_id` uniqueness
- Streak: +500 bonus every 3 valid referrals
- Attribution window: 30 days
- Admin can APPROVE/REJECT/REVERSE (reverse deducts credits + creates ledger entry)

**APIs (9):**
- `POST /api/referrals/click` — public click tracking
- `GET /api/referrals/lookup/:code` — public code validation
- `GET /api/referrals/me` — user dashboard payload (profile + attributions + rewards + share_url)
- `POST /api/referrals/qualify` — idempotent qualification trigger (dashboard calls on load)
- `GET /api/referrals/admin/overview` — stats (top referrers, credits granted, conversion rate)
- `GET /api/referrals/admin/attributions?status=...`
- `POST /api/referrals/admin/review` — admin approve/reject/reverse

**Frontend:**
- `/refer?code=XXX` — public invite landing (premium dark, persists code to localStorage)
- `/app/referrals` (also `/dashboard/referrals`) — user dashboard with hero + invite link + copy + WhatsApp/Email/Telegram/X share + stats + how-it-works + attribution table
- `/app/admin/referrals` — admin overview with 8 stats + top referrers + attribution list with approve/reject/reverse
- Dashboard "Invite & Earn" card linking to `/app/referrals`
- Signup form captures `ref_code` (localStorage + URL ?ref=), sends in register payload
- AdminLayout sidebar: "Referral Program" under Security group

### VDP (Vulnerability Disclosure Program) — April 22, 2026

**Backend (`/app/backend/routes/security_vdp.py`):**
- Public: `POST /api/security/report` (consent + rate-limit + spam + honeypot + auto-ack email + admin alert)
- Public: `POST /api/security/attachment/upload` (R2, png/jpg/pdf/txt, 10MB, 3 files max, private)
- Public: `GET /api/security/claim/:token` (reward claim link for non-account reporters)
- Admin: `GET /api/security/admin/reports` (filters: status, severity, category, reward, search)

- Admin: `POST /api/security/admin/reports/:id/notes` (internal notes)
- Admin: `POST /api/security/admin/reports/:id/grant-reward` (tier: LOW=100, MED=300, HIGH=700, CRIT=1500; auto creates user credit ledger entry OR claim link)
- Admin: `POST /api/security/admin/reports/:id/reject-reward`

**Collections:** `security_reports`, `security_report_events`, `security_report_notes`, `security_reward_claims`, `vdp_counters` (monotonic VSR-YYYY-NNNNNN)

**Anti-abuse:** 3 submissions/IP/24h · honeypot · spam phrase heuristic · disposable email detection · consent enforcement · `html.escape` on body in admin email · allowed-ext whitelist · presigned 10-min attachment URLs

**Frontend:**
- `/security` — Stripe/Linear-grade dark trust page (hero + live health card + 4-metric strip + 3 principles + scope split + timeline + rewards + FAQ + final CTA)
- `/security/report` — Premium single-column form (3 sections, drag+drop upload, honeypot, inline validation)
- `/security/report/submitted` — Success page with tracking ID
- `/app/admin/security-reports` — List view with stats, filters, status/severity/reward chips
